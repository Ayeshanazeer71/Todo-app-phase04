# Feature: Task CRUD

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to create a task with a title and optional description.
- As a user, I want to see only my tasks in a list.
- As a user, I want to toggle a task as completed or incomplete.
- As a user, I want to edit the title or description of an existing task.
- As a user, I want to delete a task I no longer need.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Task creation requires a non-empty title.
- [ ] Users cannot see or modify tasks belonging to other users.
- [ ] List filter allows toggling between "All", "Active", and "Completed".
- [ ] Confirmation appears (or graceful handling) for deletions.
