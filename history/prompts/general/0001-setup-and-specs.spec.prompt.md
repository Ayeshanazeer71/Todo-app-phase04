## Prompt

# 🚀 Phase II Todo Full-Stack Web App — Claude Code Master Prompt
(Full multi-section prompt provided by user)

## Response snapshot

I've initialized the monorepo structure and created all detailed specification files for Phase II, covering API endpoints, database schema, user features (CRUD & Auth), and UI structure.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project structure and specifications established for Phase II.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: Monorepo folders and all spec files in /specs.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Backend implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Followed Spec-Driven Development strictly by establishing documentation before code.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none
